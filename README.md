[Museum Gallery App](https://museums-vue-ui.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview
Museums Gallery is a single page application using the Vue Framework. This was a small code challenge where the object was to learn how to create a Vue app from the ground up. The App consumes the Harvard Art Museums API and displays 10 different peices of art at a time, where the user can select one to view information about a specific gallery. The user can also navigate through different galleries from the database.
